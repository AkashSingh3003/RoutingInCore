The application uses both conventional routing (defined in the endpoint middleware) and attribute routing (defined on controllers) for efficient request handling. Conventional routing allows default route patterns for MVC controllers. Attribute routing gives more control over specific route definitions for APIs. This hybrid approach improves maintainability, readability, and scalability of the routing system.
